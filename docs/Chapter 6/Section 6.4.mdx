# 6.4: The Method of Transformations

:::info[Summary of the Transformation Method]

Let $U = h(Y)$, where $h(y)$ is either an increasing or decreasing function of $y$ for all $y$ such that $f_Y(y) > 0$.

1. Find the inverse function, $y = h^{-1}(u)$.

2. Evaluate $\frac{dh^{-1}}{du} = \frac{d[h^{-1}(u)]}{du}$.

3. Find $f_U(u)$ by
   $$
   f_U(u) = f_Y[h^{-1}(u)] \left|\frac{dh^{-1}}{du} \right|.
   $$
