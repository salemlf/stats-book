The speed of a molecule in a uniform gas at equilibrium is a random variable $V$ whose density function is given by

$$
f(v) = av^2 e^{-bv^2}, \quad v > 0,
$$

where $b = m/2kT$ and $k$, $T$, and $m$ denote Boltzmann's constant, the absolute temperature, and the mass of the molecule, respectively.

a) Derive the distribution of $W = mV^2 / 2$, the kinetic energy of the molecule.

b) Find $E(W)$.
