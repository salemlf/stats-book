The joint distribution for the length of life of two different types of components operating in a system was given in Exercise 5.18 by

$$
f(y_1, y_2) =
\begin{cases}
    (1/8)y_1 e^{-(y_1 + y_2) / 2}, & y_1 > 0, y_2 > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

The relative efÔ¨Åciency of the two types of components is measured by $U = Y_2 / Y_1$.
Find the probability density function for $U$.
