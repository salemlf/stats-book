A density function sometimes used by engineers to model lengths of life of electronic components is the Rayleigh density, given by

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    \left(\frac{2y}{\theta} \right) e^{-y^2 / \theta}, & y > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

a) If $Y$ has the Rayleigh density, ﬁnd the probability density function for $U = Y^2$.

b) Use the result of part (a) to ﬁnd $E(Y)$ and $V(Y)$.
