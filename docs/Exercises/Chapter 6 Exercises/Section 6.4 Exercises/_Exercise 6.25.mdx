In Exercise 6.11, we considered two electronic components that operate independently, each with life length governed by the exponential distribution with mean $1$.
We proceeded to use the method of distribution functions to obtain the distribution of the average length of life for the two components.
Use the method of transformations to obtain the density function for the average life length of the two components.
