The Weibull density function is given by

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\alpha} my^{m - 1} e^{-y^m / \alpha}, & y > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere,}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\alpha$ and $m$ are positive constants.
This density function is often used as a model for the lengths of life of physical systems.
Suppose $Y$ has the Weibull density just given.
Find

a) the density function of $U = Y^m$.

b) $E(Y^k)$ for any positive integer $k$.
