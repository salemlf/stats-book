In Exercise 6.1, we considered a random variable $Y$ with probability density function given by

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    2(1 - y), & 0 \leq y \leq 1,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere,}
\end{cases}
$$

and used the method of distribution functions to find the density functions of

a) $U_1 = 2Y - 1$.

b) $U_2 = 1 - 2Y$.

c) $U_3 = Y^2$.

Use the method of transformation to find the densities of $U_1$, $U_2$, and $U_3$.
